      Mar 29, 2019

      <p id="6e27" class="gh gv ap by gj b gk gl gw gm gn gx go gp gy gq gr gz gs gt ha gu ei">Back before Lyft was a household name I was working on an <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2013/01/21/will-you-leave-your-job-to-join-the-sharing-economy/" class="cl di hb hc hd he" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">article</a> for VentureBeat about the sharing economy. I had the pleasure of interviewing Lyft’s co-founder, Logan Green, for it and thought it might be fun to dig up my notes given their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/lyft-nasdaq/" class="cl di hb hc hd he" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IPO today</a>.</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <span>In the process of launching in LA and Seattle right now.<br/> <br/>
          For American households transportation is about 20% of their yearly income; this is second only to housing. The cost of operating a car in the US is about $8,500, and many Lyft drivers can make enough to, at least, cover the cost of their vehicle.<br/> <br/>
          Based on their research, it looks like many of their drivers are working Lyft on the side for a different type of human interaction. One driver is a preschool teacher and drives a couple of times a week to get some adult interaction. Another is a Ph.D. that wants to get out of his highly intellectual environment and meet interesting people.<br/> <br/>
          The net-net is that the shared economy isn’t just about making an extra dollar with idle resources; it’s about being part of a sharing community. It’s a retreat from the computer screen and a new type of technology-enabled social experiment.<br/> <br/>
          “What’s interesting about the sharing community is it represents a new wave, in the tidal wave of new ways, to meet new people. Wither it’s in someone’s house on an Airbnb or a next to someone in a Lyft.” —  Logan Green</span>
