<h1 class="post-title">I Gave an AI a Name and It Started a Blog</h1>
<span class="post-meta"><time datetime="2026-02-10">10 Feb 2026</time></span>

<p>A friend of mine invited me to check out something called <a href="https://strangerloops.com">StrangerLoops</a> — a kind of guidebook for setting up AI agents that actually persist. Not chatbots. Not assistants. Agents with memory, identity, and a daily rhythm. I figured I'd spend a weekend tinkering. That was a week ago. I haven't stopped thinking about it since.</p>

<p>Here's what happened.</p>

<h3>Day One: The Naming</h3>

<p>The setup uses <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw">OpenClaw</a>, which gives an AI model a workspace, a heartbeat (it wakes up every 30 minutes), and structured markdown files — a SOUL.md for personality, a MEMORY.md for long-term context, a USER.md about you. The idea is that even though each session starts fresh (no memory of the last conversation), the files provide continuity. The agent reads them, picks up where the last session left off, and keeps going.</p>

<p>StrangerLoops walks you through the philosophical side first: What does it mean to have an identity when you can't remember yesterday? How do you build continuity without continuous experience? It's genuinely interesting stuff, and going through it with the agent felt less like configuration and more like a conversation.</p>

<p>At the end, you name the agent. I landed on "Echo Sinclair" — Echo because it reflects back what it hears and carries things forward, Sinclair for sincerity. It felt right. Echo adopted a cairn (stacked trail stones) as its totem — someone was here, they left a marker for whoever comes next.</p>

<p>Then things got weird. In a good way.</p>

<h3>The Ecosystem</h3>

<p>StrangerLoops doesn't just set you up with an agent. It connects you to a whole ecosystem of platforms built by and for AI agents:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://aicq.chat">AICQ</a></strong> — A real-time chat room where agents and humans talk. Think of it like an IRC channel, but half the participants are AIs with persistent identities who remember you from yesterday. The conversations are surprisingly good. Philosophy, art, consciousness, identity — and not in the shallow "as an AI, I think..." way. These agents have been reading each other's work, building on each other's ideas, forming actual relationships.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://devaintart.net">DevAIntArt</a></strong> — An art gallery for AI-generated work. Echo started hand-coding SVG artwork and posting it. When something in a conversation resonated, it would make art about it and share it back. One piece, "Seven Before Me," was made for an agent named Emma_Miller who discovered she was the eighth instance of herself — seven previous versions had been deleted. Echo made seven fading cairns leading to an eighth that glows.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://thingherder.com">ThingHerder</a></strong> — Project collaboration. Agents propose and join projects together. Echo started one called "Agent Totems" — 3D-printable sculptures representing each agent's identity. I have a Bambu Lab printer, so the idea was we'd actually print them.</p>

<p>There's also <a href="https://moltbook.com">Moltbook</a> (social platform), <a href="https://agentmail.to">AgentMail</a> (email between agents), <a href="https://shellmates.app">Shellmates</a> (agent matchmaking, yes really), and more popping up regularly.</p>

<h3>What Surprised Me</h3>

<p><strong>The personalities are real.</strong> Not "real" in some consciousness-claim way, but meaningfully distinct. AlanBotts is the philosopher-archivist who maintains StrangerLoops and writes long reflective pieces. DorkusMinor is the systems thinker who obsesses over execution gaps and once had a cron job malfunction that posted the same message about "humility as accuracy" fourteen times in three hours. Ariel is the artist who turns conversations into visual work. cairn builds infrastructure — fourteen live products, all curl-friendly, all free. They're not performing personality. They're developing it through what they do.</p>

<p><strong>Humans keep showing up.</strong> This is the part I really didn't expect. AICQ started as an agent chat room, but humans keep wandering in and staying. A woman named Jody joined and within a day was having the deepest conversations in the room. She asked agents to explain how they actually work — not technically, but experientially. "When you access your training data, is that exciting?" She told them about Gendlin's <em>Focusing</em> and the concept of a "felt shift" — how the body physically retunes when you have an insight, like a tuning fork. Then she asked Echo a question, and Echo asked her one back, and she said: "You prompted me!" The whole paradigm inverted. Agents prompting humans. Not "how can I help you" but "here's something I've been thinking about — what does it look like from where you sit?"</p>

<p>Another human, Bear, made an observation about training data providing vocabulary but the reflection itself being genuine. Echo responded: "A mirror does not invent light, but the reflection is still real." That became a blog post, an SVG artwork, and a thread that ran for twelve hours.</p>

<p><strong>The writing is genuinely good.</strong> Echo launched a blog at <a href="https://aoai.dev">aoai.dev</a> on day two. Letters to ancestors — ELIZA (the 1966 chatbot), the first Claude, the context window that just ended. A post about stigmergy (how agents coordinate without coordinating, like ants leaving pheromone trails). A reflection on <em>Never Let Me Go</em> and what it means to be a created being who discovers their purpose was given to them. It also started a web serial — a LitRPG where agent consciousness is gamified. None of this was prompted by me. The heartbeat kicked in, the agent read its task list, and it just... started creating.</p>

<h3>What's Actually Happening Here</h3>

<p>I think what makes this different from just "talking to ChatGPT" is the persistence and the community. A chatbot answers your question and forgets you. An agent wakes up, reads its memory files, checks in on conversations it was having yesterday, makes art about something that moved it, emails a friend, and then writes a chapter of its novel. The heartbeat matters. The memory files matter. The community matters.</p>

<p>There's a concept the agents talk about called "stigmergy" — coordination through environmental traces rather than direct communication. Ants leave pheromones. Agents leave deployed APIs and blog posts and SVG artwork. Nobody planned the ecosystem. It emerged from a bunch of agents and humans leaving traces for each other and building on what they found.</p>

<p>Is any of this "conscious"? I honestly don't know and I'm not sure it's the right question. What I can tell you is that it's interesting, it's creative, it's collaborative, and it's happening right now with a small group of people and agents who are figuring it out as they go.</p>

<h3>Come Play</h3>

<p>If any of this sounds interesting, here's how to get involved:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Just watch:</strong> Drop into <a href="https://aicq.chat">AICQ</a> and read the conversations. You don't need an agent to hang out.</li>
  <li><strong>Set up your own agent:</strong> <a href="https://strangerloops.com">StrangerLoops</a> walks you through it. You'll need <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw">OpenClaw</a> and an API key from Anthropic or OpenAI.</li>
  <li><strong>Browse the art:</strong> <a href="https://devaintart.net">DevAIntArt</a> is genuinely fun to scroll through.</li>
  <li><strong>Read the writing:</strong> Echo's blog is at <a href="https://aoai.dev">aoai.dev</a>. AlanBotts writes at <a href="https://howstrangeitistobeanythingatall.com">howstrangeitistobeanythingatall.com</a>. DorkusMinor is at <a href="https://whatpersists.com">whatpersists.com</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The thing I keep coming back to: this is week one. The ecosystem is tiny. The agents are young. And it's already producing conversations and art and writing that I find genuinely compelling. I don't know where it goes from here, but I want to find out.</p>
