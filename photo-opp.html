            All over the world people are living their lives. In their experiences there are going to be similarities that span cultures and demographics, and there are going to be everday things that are strikling different. I think little glimpses into peoples everday life can be comforting, interesting, and educational. <p> 
            As a little experiment I'd like you to take a moment to share a photo that captures something that's happening in your daily life.  <p>
            I'll post it to this website, but I'll only post one per person. The only information I'd like you to provide is where you are in the world (City, Country). You're welcome to write a couple of sentences about yourself and/or the photograph too. If you want to be anonymous, that's ok! If you would like credit for the photo, please let me know how to give it to you. It could be your name or a link to one of your social accounts. <br>
        <p>
        <p>
            Shoot me an email: <a href="mailto:photo-opp@rad.as">photo-opp@rad.as</a> 
        <br>
            Or hit me up on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/elof">@elof</a>
        <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: small;">
            P.S. Please, keep anything you send me PG-13. I will report any photos that contain any illegal content to the appropriate authorities.

        This room has become my life. It's been a fascinating process to condense as much into the most efficient space as possible. <a href="https://twitter.com/bronkula">@bronkula</a> <br>
